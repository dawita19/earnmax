The ERD PDF would visually represent:

All tables with their columns

Primary and foreign key relationships

Special constraints and indexes

VIP level hierarchy

Transaction flow between entities

For actual PDF generation, you would:

Generate the diagram from PlantUML

Or use a database modeling tool like pgModeler

Export as PDF with:

Table boxes showing columns

Relationship lines with cardinality

Color coding for different functional areas

This structure provides comprehensive database documentation that:

Defines the schema visually (PUMl)

Provides executable migration scripts

Includes the VIP level reference data

Offers a printable ERD reference (PDF)
